bgp script helped me to push bgp password to over a 200 branch locations in WAN network for certain bgp neighbors, not to all.
In this script I used some lines in bgp config in order to export certain piece of configuration and filter ip address of bgp neighbors to which I want to configure bgp password.

finding_config_lines script helped me to see on which device I need to put new tacacs commands. I want add new tacacs commands at just certain routers model as you can see in the script.
